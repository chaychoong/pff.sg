# Expenses

## General Strategy

It is a very good habit to track how much you spend. Start off by recording all your expenses. Categorise them. Figure out your spending pattern. There are a wide variety of apps out there that can help you do just that, or you can create your own spreadsheet.

There are generally four types of expenses

* Recurring: meals, transportation, bills
* Infrequent: vacations, new gadgets
* Milestones: wedding, house, education
* Unexpected: hospitalisation, gadget repairs

Figure out how much you need for each category, and start saving up for them.

## Funds

Whether you believe in the YNAB methodology or not, you need a Rainy Day fund. Set aside at least 6 to 12 months worth of your monthly recurring expenses. The fund must be very liquid, as you may need to tap on it quickly in case of emergencies - such as hospital trips - or when you lose your source of regular income.

You also need to set aside funds for each of your major goals. If you plan to get married or buy a house, make sure you start saving money a few years in advance.

Do not house your essential funds in investments. You do not want a stock market crash to jeopardise your child's education fund, or shrink your wedding budget when your favourite meme stock crashes.

## Credit Cards

There are two types of credit cards, **cashback** cards and **miles** \(or reward points\) cards. If you travel often and enjoy travelling, go for miles. If you believe that the miles game is a scam, stick to cashback cards.

Choose a credit card that fits your lifestyle, **not the other way round**. If you have not yet figured out your spending pattern, I recommend choosing a simple cashback card to start off with.

Beware, most credit cards come with annual fees \(usually around $200 per year!\). 

* For cashback cards, the fees can usually be waived if you use it often. **Set a reminder** to call them for a waiver every year; they will not offer it to you automatically. 
* For miles cards, waivers are not always possible. However, they will usually offer miles if you pay the annual fees

Always pay back your credit card bills in full each month, on time. Late fees and interest rates are extremely high, and can easily snowball out of control.

Always read through your credit card statement. Billing mistakes happen more often than you think, so be sure to catch them early!
