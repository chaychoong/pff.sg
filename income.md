# Income, CPF, and Taxes

## Income

### Salaried Employee

If you are a salaried employee, you are likely to receive

* A monthly salary
* Annual Wage Supplement \(AWS\) a.k.a. the 13th month bonus
* Variable Bonus \(VB\)
* Employer CPF contributions

Some companies may also provide flexible benefits that you can claim some of your spendings against.

### Self-Employed

If you are a freelancer, or currently working on a startup, be sure to 

* Pay yourself first
* Consider topping up your own CPF

{% endhint %}

### Growth

In general, the most straightforward way to grow your net worth is to **upgrade yourself** and find better opportunities - such as getting a promotion with a higher salary, a higher paying job, or creating another/a better business

## Central Provident Fund

The CPF system forces Singaporeans to save money. There are three types of CPF accounts:

* Ordinary: for housing, insurance and education
* Special: for retirement
* Medisave: for medical and health insurance expenses
* Retirement: this account is created when you reach 55

### Contribution

If you are a salaried employee in Singapore, chances are you and your employer are obliged to contribute to your CPF.

If you are self-employed, you may be required to contribute to your Medisave account. It is recommended to voluntarily contribute to your three CPF accounts.

### Interest

CPF accounts have very high interest, as compared to your bank account. It may not be comparable to the stock market, but it is pretty good.

* Ordinary: ~2.5%
* Others: ~5%

### Usage

#### Using OA for housing

{% endhint %}

Unless you are very cash rich **and** you are not confident of beating ~2.5% through investments, please use CPF for paying for your house

#### Use SA for investments

A guaranteed 4% is good, but may not be good enough for you. Luckily, you can use your OA or SA for investments.

Do not use your OA for investments if you are still relying on it to pay off your housing mortgage.

Will moving Into a higher tax bracket cause you to have a lower net income? **No**, that is not how the progressive tax system works. 

Singapore follows the progressive tax system. Here is a video of how it works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJhsjUPDulw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJhsjUPDulw)

### Taxable Income

Not all the money you earn is taxable: [https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/What-is-Taxable--What-is-Not/](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/What-is-Taxable--What-is-Not/)

### Chargeable Income

There is a list of tax deductions and reliefs here: [https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals--Reliefs--Expenses--Donations-/](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Deductions-for-Individuals--Reliefs--Expenses--Donations-/)

Notable items are

* Donations. Donate more often!
* Supplementary Retirement Scheme. Do consider opening an account if you are already investing a significant amount per month.

$$
Chargeable\ Income = Taxable\ Income - Deductions - Reliefs
$$

Your tax payable is then calculated by applying the progressive tax rates on your chargeable income.
