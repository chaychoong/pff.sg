# Introduction

## About

This microsite is my knowledge wiki on the topic of personal finance, in the Singaporean context. Feel free to submit a Pull Request [here](https://github.com/chaychoong/pff.sg) if you have any suggested changes.

The scope of this wiki is documenting the minimal knowledge required to 

* have some understanding about your own money
* formulate some basic strategies for achieving your personal finance goals

{% hint style="info" %}
In this wiki, hint blocks like this indicate my personal strategy/choice/opinions.

Some of my personal finance goals:

* I know how much money I have
* I can afford essentials comfortably
* I am on track to pay off my debts
* I am on track to meeting my quality of life goals
* If I lose your main source of income, I can survive on my savings until I find an alternate source of income
* If I die, those who depend on my income will not be significant affected, financially speaking
* I have plans for where my money goes when I die
{% endhint %}

You are probably sick of hearing the "do your own research" clich√©. I mean, if you are here, you are in the process of doing your own research. Kudos to you! But before making any decisions, **do another round of research** with the primary sources to ensure that what you have read is accurate and up-to-date.
