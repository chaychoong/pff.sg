# Net Worth

Net Worth is a useful metric to measure one's financial health. People often use it for goal setting purposes \("100k NW by 30"\), but the process of calculation your net worth itself is a good introductory exercise in figuring out what you own. 

It is not uncommon to have negative net worth, especially upon graduation or after taking a housing loan etc.

The general formula for Net Worth is

$$
Net\ Worth = Cash+Assets-Liabilities
