# Net Worth

Net Worth is a useful metric to measure one's financial health. People often use it for goal setting purposes \("$100k by 30"\), but the process of calculation your net worth itself is a good introductory exercise in **figuring out what you own**. 

It is not uncommon to have negative net worth, especially upon graduation or after taking a housing loan etc.

The general formula for Net Worth is

$$
Net\ Worth = Cash+Assets-Liabilities
$$

## Figuring out your Net Worth

The easiest way to get started in your personal finance journey is to make a list of what you own. Don't be too obsessed with the tiny details; it is okay to leave out cash in your piggy bank or your Kopitiam card.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that can contribute to your net worth calculation:

### Cash

* Bank accounts
* Cards with stored credits
* Digital wallets
* Piggy bank

### Assets

* Brokerage accounts
* CDP account
* CPF
* Large assets: house, car, music instruments, etc. things with resale value

### Liabilities

* Bank loans
* "Father-Mother-Scholarship" repayment
* Outstanding credit card bills
