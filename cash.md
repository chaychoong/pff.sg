# Cash

## General Strategy

Do **not** spend too much time and effort shifting your money around just to get the very best interest rates. Pick a good strategy, stick with it, and stop worrying about losing out on better deals \(a.k.a. FOMO\).

### Interest

Large institutions offer generous interest rates for you to keep your money with them, because they know how to use your money to generate even greater returns. For example, if they offer you 1% interest, but issue a loan with 2.5% interest, they pocket the 1.5% difference. At scale, that is a lot of money.

Note that there is usually a cap on the amount of interest they give you.

### Liquidity

Liquidity is how fast you can convert the assets into cash, and withdraw it without incurring high costs. 

Generally speaking, the easier and cheaper \(i.e. more liquid\) it is to withdraw your money, the lower interest you should expect to get.

### Deposit Insurance Scheme

In the event a bank goes bankrupt, the Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation \(SDIC\) insures up to $75k per depositor per bank.

If you are uncertain if your funds will be safe with a particular company, make sure that the product is protected by the Deposit Insurance Scheme.

## Bank accounts

> Liquidity: Very high. Almost instant withdrawal and transfers
>
> Interest: Low base interest rates, but can potentially be quite high if you meet their criteria \(taking loans with them, spend money with their credit cards, etc.\). Interest rate changes all the time. High cap

Bank accounts are free to open, but require minimum deposits to maintain. There are no major downsides to having multiple accounts, so open as many as you want. However, you should have one primary account - preferably the one that you can earn the highest interest in.

If you are planning to stay overseas for an extended period, also consider opening an international bank account.

## Insurance Savings Plans

> Liquidity: Not very high. Takes a couple of days to withdraw money into your bank account usually. There are usually withdrawal fees to deter frequent withdrawal activities
>
> Interest: Lower effort required to get decent interest rates \(can be up to 1.5-2%\). Interest rate may change. Low cap though \(e.g. high interest only for the first $10k\)

Most of these accounts are free to open, and they offer decent interest for the first $10k or so. If you are willing to go through the trouble of opening accounts and moving your money around, you can choose to stash some money here.

## Cash Funds / Money Market Funds

> Liquidity: Not very high. Takes a couple of days, or even over a week, to process the withdrawal.
>
> Interest: Low. Changes sometimes, but often hovering around 1-1.5%. No cap

Think of this as very low risk investments. As they have the lowest rates around, use this as a last resort, if you are extremely cash rich and have very low risk appetite.

## Fixed Deposits / Bonds / Endowment Plans

> Liquidity: Low. There is either a lock-in period, or a hefty penalty for early withdrawal
>
> Interest: Sometimes they can be pretty high, up to 1.8-2%. Interest rates are usually fixed \(on what it is at the point of signing it\). High cap

Use these products only if you are absolutely sure that you will only need the money a few years later, and the interest rate offered is competitive.
